# Guitar Hero
This game is a project I created during school over the period of 1 month, using Java and JFrame to output a interactable game into a window. The game keeps score whether the buttons are hit at the correct timing, or hit at all, depending on whether there is a tile in line.

To play the game you must:
  - download the .java files and upload them into your IDE
  - download .wav files for the songs and edit the startGame() method in the GamePanel.java file to include the correct file locations
